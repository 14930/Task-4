## 💻 Technical Documentation

### ⚙️ Physics Engine Architecture

**🔬 Soft-Body Deformation Algorithm:**

The system uses a spring-mass model with Verlet integration:

```python
# Force Calculations
F_spring = -k × displacement              # Hooke's Law
F_damping = -c × velocity                 # Viscous damping
F_external = user_force × influence_factor # User interaction

# Verlet Integration Scheme
acceleration = (F_spring + F_damping + F_external) / mass
velocity_new = velocity_old + acceleration × Δt
position_new = position_old + velocity_new × Δt
```

**📊 Influence Function:**

Implements cubic falloff for realistic tissue compression:

```python
influence = (1 - distance/radius)³  # Cubic distance falloff
force_vector = base_force × influence × direction_normalized
```

**🎨 Rendering Pipeline:**

1. **Vertex Transformation**: CPU-side deformation calculations
2. **Normal Recalculation**: Per-frame surface normal updates
3. **PBR Shading**: Physically-based rendering with Blinn-Phong model
4. **Shadow Mapping**: 2048×2048 resolution shadow atlas
5. **Anti-Aliasing**: Multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA 4x)

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**❌ Issue: "Model appears black or unlit"**
```
✅ Solution: 
1. Update GPU drivers to the latest version
2. Verify OpenGL version: Must be 3.3 or higher
3. Check graphics card compatibility with Panda3D
```

**❌ Issue: "VR hand not responding to keyboard"**
```
✅ Solution:
1. Verify VR mode is enabled (button should display green)
2. Ensure keyboard focus is on the application window
3. Check that no other application is capturing WASD input
```

**❌ Issue: "Lag during tissue deformation"**
```
✅ Solution:
1. Reduce mesh resolution in cutting.py (mesh_res parameter)
2. Lower force slider value to reduce physics calculations
3. Close unnecessary background applications
4. Consider upgrading RAM if using complex models
```

**❌ Issue: "Git LFS models not downloading"**
```
✅ Solution:
1. Install Git LFS: git lfs install
2. Pull LFS files: git lfs pull
3. Verify .gitattributes configuration
